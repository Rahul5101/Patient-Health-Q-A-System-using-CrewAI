why we make private the perform_summerization method
Making the _perform_summarization method "private" (or, more accurately, non-public) within the CustomSummarizerTool class in Python is a common practice for improving code organization, maintainability, and clarity, according to DataCamp. It's about signaling developer intent rather than strictly enforcing access like in other languages, says Analytics Vidhya. 
Here's why this is beneficial:
1. Encapsulation and abstraction
Encapsulation refers to bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class), and restricting direct access to some of the class's components. The _perform_summarization method handles the specific logic of interacting with the summarization library (e.g., Hugging Face transformers). By making it non-public, you encapsulate this internal implementation detail, preventing it from being accessed or accidentally misused directly from outside the CustomSummarizerTool class.
Abstraction is about simplifying the system by showing only what is needed. The user of the CustomSummarizerTool doesn't need to know the intricate details of how summarization is performed. They just need to know that the tool takes a file path and returns a summary. The public interface of the tool (the _run method) handles the high-level logic of choosing the correct summarization method based on the input file type. 
2. Controlled access and data integrity
A private method serves as a strong hint to other developers that it's an internal helper method and not part of the class's public interface. This discourages external code from directly calling or modifying the summarization logic. By restricting direct access, you reduce the chances of unexpected behavior or data corruption if the internal implementation of summarization changes in the future.
If you were to change the underlying summarization library or modify the way the model is initialized, you would only need to update the _perform_summarization method and the public method that calls it (_run), without affecting any external code that uses the CustomSummarizerTool. This makes the code more robust to changes and reduces the likelihood of breaking existing code. 
3. Improved readability and maintainability
Making helper methods non-public helps to clarify the purpose and scope of different methods within the class. Methods starting with an underscore are clearly designated for internal use, making the code easier to understand for anyone reading it.
A private method can break down a larger method into smaller, more manageable units. For instance, the _run method focuses on dispatching based on file type, while the private helper methods (_summarize_url, _summarize_excel, _summarize_plain_text, and _perform_summarization) handle their specific tasks, improving modularity and readability. 
4. Reducing the public API surface
Every public method adds to the complexity of the class's interface. By making methods like _perform_summarization non-public, you reduce the number of methods that outside code needs to be aware of. This simplifies the API and makes the class easier to use correctly, according to Code with Jason.
A smaller public API makes it easier to understand how the object interacts with the rest of the program and reduces the "understandability cost", notes Code with Jason. 
In essence, while Python doesn't strictly enforce privacy, using the underscore convention for _perform_summarization serves as a vital communication tool within your code. It signals to other developers, and even to your future self, that this method is an internal implementation detail and should not be accessed directly. This promotes a more robust, maintainable, and understandable codebase.
